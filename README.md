## Przemek

---

### üëã Intro

This page tries to be the "user manual" for Przemek (that's me) for those who want to or need to interact with Przemek. In other words, it's a "how to work with me" page. It is intended to be helpful. Feel free to suggest changes if you think it is needed. I maintain it myself and try to be direct. If anything seems pretentious or overbearing, let me know so I can change it. It is never finished. It's not meant as a replacement to actually getting to know each other.

For starters, I am and CD/DC on DISC profile.

### üìú Bio

I've been a product manager for the bigger part of my professional career. Before that I worked for a couple companies in insurance industry. If you're interested in details, LinkedIn has it.

I graduated from Warsaw University of Technology, where I received my M.S. in production engineering. In information systems, to be more specific.

### üòÑ Name pronunciation hint

My full first name is actually Przemys≈Çaw, but nobody ever called me that, not even my parents. Use Przemek. The phonetic spelling is p-sh-eh-m-eh-k and there's plenty audio samples online. Don't worry if you can't pronounce it, I won't mind it. I've been getting many emails starting with "Hi, Kulik" ("this Przemek thing can't be his first name, can it?") and it's fine. The best one I've ever got started with "Hi Kilimanjaro" - go figure üòÑ.

### üçÖ Flaws

I like to think I am an open book, transparent and direct. I strive to live by these values. That's why I am sharing here some of the flaws I know I have. Listing them here is not an excuse, I am fully responsible for improving on these things.

1. I look "serious" / "scary" most of the time. It's my "resting face". It's OK to remind me of that or ask what's going on.
2. My tone of voice may seem harsh even if I don't mean it. I don't know if it's the Polish accent or something else. It's OK to remind me of that and say, "that sounded harsh, I would appreciate a calmer tone."
3. I tend to get emotional (angry, sad...). I know how it sounds, but it's not you, it's me. I'm working on it.
4. I may seem as difficult to work with. I hold myself to high standards. Sometimes it may seem like I'm "making it hard" for no apparent reason. The fault is mine. Feel free to stop me and ask clarifying "why" questions.
5. I sometimes fail or forget to recognize good effort or performance. I have seen it, believe me. It's OK to ask, "how do you think I did there."

I'm sure I have more flaws that affect my professional life. Please contact me to have it added or if you prefer to do it anonymously, ask someone you and I both know, who would be willing to submit it.

### üåü Strengths

Still looking. I'm not trying to be coy here. Let me try with something basic and simple:

1. One of my managers used "pitbull attitude" in my yearly appraisal once. He meant it in a positive way. I'll take it.
2. If you're "one of my own" (and if you're reading it you most likely are) I will fight for you even if you mess up. Then, we'll talk.
3. I can be convinced. I have strong opinions, but you can change them. Don't give up too early.

### üíú Values, beliefs, style

Things, which are neither flaws nor strengths (?). Something I value and try to practice.

- Enthusiasm and passion - we're here for a reason, let's show we mean it.
- Hard work ethic - hard work beats talent and practice makes perfect
- If you feel like quitting, remember why you started. 
- Humility - as we say in jiu jitsu, the belt only covers two inches of your, well.. back. You have to cover the rest. Titles, as belts, only go so far...
- Work/life balance - we're here for a reason, but there‚Äôs life after work. Live it now. Now will never come again.
- I assume good will. Period.
- Underpromise and overdeliver - never opposite. It's not to say to undepromise what you plan for anyway. It's about not overpromising for no reason.

### üêâ Hic sunt dracones

We all have things, which annoy us, right?

- Taking credit for somebody else‚Äôs work.
- Going around me with something that is about me.

### üö¶ Pointers from others

This is what others said when I asked them for input to this "user guide". Their words, not mine. I didn't edit anything. I didn't order them in any particular way. They are added here as they come.

- Be direct and cut to the chase if you want to make an approach
- Before the approach, do your home work, ensure it is something that means business to Przemek
- Expect him to say, "Don't make your lack of planning my crisis." He will make it clear but will endeavor to help/do the right thing. This applies for the cross-functional teams. If you are his team member, he makes you comfortable and guides you out of the crisis.
- Expect him to challenge the worthiness of anything you expect him to be engaging with - He values his time/effort and it is fair.
- Respect his priorities - It doesn't matter however entitled you think your priorities are! Also, at a glance, he may come across as someone not respecting yours, but believe me, he does.
- When he says, 'No' - he means it. Don't be na√Øve and try escalations. The battle will only become harder and statistics suggest, he will eventually win. Focus your efforts on understanding his rationale behind the 'No' - your peace lies there!
- When talking with Przemek, you might get the impression that he is ignoring you, he's not.  He is usually thinking about 12 things at once. So, in fact he IS listening.  Don‚Äôt take it personally.
- Talking directly with Przemek is MUCH better than email.  In person is even BETTER. If you have a quick question, then ping him or do a quick call and turn ON your camera.
- Przemek is extremely work/life balance oriented. If you have or require any personal time, then let him know what is going on in your life and he will listen and offer good advice. It‚Äôs not all about work.
- If you do your job, then you will be rewarded so just do your damn job.
- Przemek is not hands on. Occasionally he will ask to see what is going on in certain areas, but for the most part will trust you in your decision making.
- When you have one on one meetings, he will eventually start to answer emails. This in the signal to end the meeting.
- He has two cats, one named Xerox and another I never see so have no idea what its name is. To be frank I call most cats ‚ÄúCat‚Äù anyway.
- Put thought into your meetings with Przemek, have an agenda and go through it. Even if it‚Äôs in your head. He will appreciate that.
- If you treat Przemek with respect, it will be returned.
- He doesn't small talk much, and is usually very matter of fact during business hours. If you travel together, then you will see that he's quite conversational and has a great sense of humor outside of business hours
- Don't be afraid if he's giving a someone outside his team a hard time in a meeting. He is passionate about his products and team, and will make sure to do right for them. But also know that he's very understanding of his team members and supports them no matter what.
- Always has time for you if you need his help no matter how busy his schedule is. But, don't abuse it, he appreciates self-starters, go-getters.
- He is not "full of surprises". He wouldn't try to catch you off guard, throw you under the bus in front of others, or snap at you for no reason
- Don't expect him to hold your hand to do your work. You do your work and make your decisions and take them forward. This means that he doesn't micromanage and he also lets you take all the credit for your good work. But, asking for guidance is always welcome

### üí¨ Communication

#### ***Voice vs Text***

I don't like writing (or reading) long messages (emails, chats etc.). I understand there are needed sometimes, but I'd always prefer a short (or long) conversation over a long text.

#### ***Social media***

I do have accounts on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and LinkedIn. I use Facebook and Instagram for personal stuff only and I check them only during weekends.
I user Twitter and LinkedIn for professional stuff and I don't use them during weekends.

#### ***Don't assume anything***

TL;DR: Check with me first.

As one of my flaws I documented above says, there's a chance I have misrepresented my own thoughts. Don't try to second guess me - ask for clarification. There's a chance that I meant something else or wasn't clear enough or it looks differently now that you mentioned it.

#### ***Don't wait***

Are you blocked or need clarification on something? Concerned by a rumor? Need some advice? Very few things are more important than talking to you. Reach out to me in whichever way is comfortable for you. Call me, message me on chat, email me, or set up an appointment but it doesn't have to wait for our next meeting if we have one scheduled.

#### ***Meeting requests***

Just because my calendar shows an empty slot, it doesn't mean it's available. I'm not always blocking time for personal / solo activities. If I decline your request, I give a reason most of the time. Check back with me about possible time slots.

#### ***Feedback***

Do give it. I welcome it, even if it's not evident. The format is up to you. Talk to me. Send me a message / email. Meet me after work (in person or remote). Whatever works best for you.

I don't like wasting time, so when I'm in the car and not talking to somebody, I listen to podcasts. Topics vary but I stay away from politics, news etc.
