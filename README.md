### Przemek

#### Intro

This page tries to be the 'user manual' for Przemek (that's me) for those who want to interact with Przemek. It is intended to be helpful. Feel free to suggest changes if you think it is needed. I maintain it myself and try to be direct. If anything seems pretentious or overbearing, let me know so I can change it.

#### Bio

I've been a product manager for the bigger part of my professional career. Before that I worked for a couple companies in insurance industry. If you're interested in details, LinkedIn has it.

I graduated from Warsaw University of Technology, where I received my M.S. in production engineering. In information systems to be more specific.

#### Name pronunciation hint ðŸ˜„

My full first name is actually PrzemysÅ‚aw, but nobody ever called me that, not even my parents. Use Przemek. The phonetic spelling is p-sh-eh-m-eh-k and there's plenty audio samples online. Don't worry if you can't pronounce it, I won't mind it. I've been getting many emails starting with "Hi, Kulik" ("this Przemek thing can't be his first name, can it?") and it's fine. The best one I've ever got started with "Hi Kilimanjaro" - go figure ðŸ˜„.

#### Flaws

I like to think I am an open book, transparent and direct. I strie to live by these values. In the spirit of that I am sharing here some of the flaws I know I have. Listing them here is not an exacuse, I am fully responsible for improving on these things.

1. I look "serious" most of the time. It's my 'resting face'. It's OK to remind me of that or ask what's going on.
2. English is my 3rd language. While I think it's good, my choice of words may be off. If something in what I say/write does not seem right to you, feel free to ask and correct.
3. My tone of voice may seem harsh even if I don't mean it. I don't know if it's the Polish accent or something alse. It's OK to remind me of that and say "that sounded harsh, I would appreciate a more calmer tone".
